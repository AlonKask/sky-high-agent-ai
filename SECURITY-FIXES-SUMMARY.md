- **Added enhanced rate limiting** with detailed violation tracking

### 2. Configuration Security Enhancement
- **Enhanced configuration validation** with environment-specific checks
- **Added fallback configuration** to prevent application crashes
- **Improved error handling** for missing environment variables
- **Added configuration security logging** for audit trails

### 3. Security Event System Improvement
- **Added retry mechanisms** for failed security event logging
- **Implemented localStorage backup** for critical events when network fails
- **Enhanced security event details** with retry counts and fallback indicators
- **Added automatic retry service** for failed events every 30 seconds

### 4. Security Headers and CSP Updates
- **Updated Content Security Policy** to support Cloudflare Turnstile
- **Enhanced security headers** configuration for production
- **Added wildcard Supabase domains** for better compatibility
- **Updated CORS configuration** for secure origins

### 5. Enhanced Security Monitoring
- **Added comprehensive security service** with multiple monitoring capabilities
- **Implemented console error monitoring** with pattern detection
- **Added memory usage monitoring** for potential attacks
- **Network activity monitoring** with 403 error tracking
- **CSP violation monitoring** with detailed logging

### 6. Application Security Enhancements
- **Enhanced error handling** throughout security functions
- **Added device fingerprinting** for session validation
- **Improved session management** with enhanced validation
- **Added suspicious activity pattern detection**

## üîß CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS

### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your-turnstile-site-key
VITE_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
VITE_API_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co/functions/v1
```

### Security Features Implemented:
1. **Automatic retry mechanism** for failed security events
2. **Local storage backup** for critical security events
3. **Enhanced rate limiting** with violation severity tracking
4. **Comprehensive activity monitoring** across multiple vectors
5. **Configuration validation** with environment-specific rules
6. **Graceful degradation** for missing configuration values

## üìä SECURITY METRICS

### Monitoring Capabilities:
- **Real-time threat level assessment** based on security events
- **Risk score calculation** with weighted severity factors
- **Suspicious activity counting** with pattern recognition
- **Memory usage tracking** for potential DoS attacks
- **Network failure monitoring** for infrastructure issues
- **CSP violation tracking** for content security policy breaches

### Audit Logging:
- **All security events** are logged with comprehensive details
- **Failed attempts** are recorded with retry mechanisms
- **Configuration validation failures** are tracked for compliance
- **Data access requests** are audited with justification requirements
- **Cross-user access** is logged with role-based permissions

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Deploy with proper environment variables** using `.env.template`
2. **Monitor security dashboard** for any remaining issues
3. **Test all authentication flows** to ensure no regressions
4. **Review database permissions** for any additional restrictions needed
5. **Set up monitoring alerts** for critical security events

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

- All database functions now include `SET search_path TO 'public'` for security
- Security event logging includes automatic retry and localStorage backup
- Configuration validation prevents application crashes with fallback values
- Enhanced monitoring covers console errors, memory usage, and network activity
- CSP headers updated to support all required external services

The application is now significantly more secure with comprehensive monitoring, enhanced error handling, and robust security event logging systems.

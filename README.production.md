# Select Business Class CRM - Production Guide

## üöÄ Production Deployment

This CRM system has been optimized for production deployment with comprehensive security, performance, and monitoring features.

### ‚úÖ Security Features Implemented

- **Authentication Security**: Enhanced session management with device fingerprinting
- **Database Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all sensitive tables
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation of all user inputs
- **Rate Limiting**: API and authentication endpoint protection
- **Security Headers**: Complete CSP, HSTS, and anti-clickjacking protection
- **Audit Logging**: All sensitive operations are logged for compliance

### üéØ Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading for all major route components
- **Bundle Optimization**: Separate vendor, UI, and utility chunks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Core Web Vitals tracking and reporting
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and monitoring
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading and proper compression

### üìä Monitoring & Analytics

The system includes comprehensive monitoring:

- **Performance Metrics**: Page load times, Core Web Vitals
- **Security Events**: Audit trail of all sensitive operations  
- **Error Tracking**: Production-safe logging with data sanitization
- **User Analytics**: Agent performance and system usage metrics

### üîß Deployment Configuration

#### Environment Variables Required

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Security Keys (generate new ones for production)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-encryption-key
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key

# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-user
SMTP_PASS=your-smtp-password

# External APIs
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret
```

#### Nginx Configuration

Use the provided `nginx.production.conf` with:
- SSL certificates configured
- Rate limiting enabled
- Security headers applied
- Gzip compression active

#### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build production image
docker build -t crm-app .

# Run with environment variables
docker run -p 443:443 \
  -e SUPABASE_URL=$SUPABASE_URL \
  -e SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=$SUPABASE_ANON_KEY \
  crm-app
```

### üß™ Security Validation

Run the security linter before deployment:

```bash
# Check database security
npx supabase db lint

# Validate security headers (in browser console)
import { validateSecurityHeaders } from './src/utils/securityHeaders';
validateSecurityHeaders().then(console.log);
```

### üìà Performance Optimization

The application uses several performance strategies:

1. **Route-based Code Splitting**: Each page loads independently
2. **Vendor Chunk Separation**: Third-party libraries cached separately
3. **Resource Preloading**: Critical routes preloaded based on user behavior
4. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of unused resources

### üîç Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Authentication Problems**:
- Check Supabase URL configuration
- Verify RLS policies aren't blocking legitimate access
- Clear browser storage if sessions are stuck

**Performance Issues**:
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in browser dev tools
- Check network tab for slow API calls
- Verify code splitting is working (chunks loading separately)

**Security Warnings**:
- Review CSP violations in browser console
- Check security event logs in Supabase
- Validate all environment variables are set

### üìû Support

For production issues:
1. Check application logs via the production logger
2. Review security events in the Supabase dashboard
3. Monitor performance metrics for anomalies
4. Contact the development team with specific error details

### üîê Compliance Notes

This system is designed to handle sensitive customer data (PII, payment info) and includes:
- Encryption at rest for sensitive fields
- Audit trails for all data access
- Role-based access controls
- Data retention policies
- GDPR compliance features

Regular security audits and penetration testing are recommended for production environments handling sensitive travel and payment data.
